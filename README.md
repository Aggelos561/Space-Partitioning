# KD-Tree and Voronoi Diagram Visualization

1. **KD-Tree Implementation**: A KD-Tree is a data structure used for efficient range searches and nearest neighbor queries in a k-dimensional space. The project includes a KD-Tree implementation that allows you to build a tree from a set of points and search for points within a specified rectangular region.

2. **Voronoi Diagram and Delaunay Triangulation Visualization**: The project also includes visualization of the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation for a set of random points.

## KD-Tree Implementation

The KD-Tree implementation in this project allows you to:

- Build a KD-Tree from a set of points.
- Search for points that fall within a given rectangular region.

## Voronoi Diagram and Delaunay Triangulation Visualization

The Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation visualization feature allows you to:

- Generate random points.
- Visualize the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation based on the generated points.
